# bpn

The goal of this project is to ease the process of 3D scientific data
visualization.

We aim to achieve this by:

1. Easing the burden that python's package management system puts on
   blender python developers because blender comes bundled with python.
2. Providing a way to clean up and inject modules into blender's python
   console.
3. Providing instructions on how to set up a development workflow using
   blender, python and VSCode.
4. How do I use the python debugger as much as possible?
   - Simple use case: visualization in blender not required during debugging
   - Visualization is required in blender while debugging

## Installation instructions

1. Download blender (in zip format)
2. Make sure that the path string to the blender executable has the
   string 'blender' in it
3. set paths
4. install pip for blender's python
5. install all the required packages using blender --python
   $_requirementsCheck.py
6. Setting up VSCode for blender python development
